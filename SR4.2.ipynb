    "Linear Search Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that checks every element in the list one by one until the target element is found or the list ends Binary search, on the other hand, is a more efficient algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, reducing the size of the list to search by a factor of two each time. In summary, binary search performs faster than linear search due to its logarithmic time complexity, but it requires the list to be sorted. Linear search, while less efficient, does not require the list to be sorted and is easier to implement"
